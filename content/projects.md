These are the projects, both technical and non-technical, that currently occupy most of my time.

## FreeBSD

As an active contributor to the FreeBSD Project, I focus on improving and modernizing its documentation.
I am a member of the Documentation Engineering Team (doceng@) and also serve as the Core Team Secretary, supporting project governance and coordination.

One of my key contributions was leading the migration of FreeBSD's documentation system from DocBook to Hugo/AsciiDoc, streamlining the workflow and enhancing accessibility for contributors.
Additionally, I have participated in multiple working groups aimed at refining and expanding the documentation, ensuring that FreeBSD remains well-documented and user-friendly for both newcomers and experienced users.

## QtEmu

[QtEmu](https://gitlab.com/qtemu/gui) is a graphical user interface for [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org).
It has the ability to run virtual operating systems on native systems.
This way you can easily test a new operating system or try a Live CD on your system without any troubles and dangers.

Technologies: Qt Creator, Qt, C++
