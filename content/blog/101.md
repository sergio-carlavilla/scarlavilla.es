My name is Sergio, I live in Spain and I work as a Software Architect.

In this blog I'm going to share the state of my projects.

Which projects?

* Collaborating with the FreeBSD project in my spare time.
* Improving the FreeBSD website and documentation sites.
* Trying to maintain (basically failing) QtEmu
* Other things
