I enjoy working with a variety of technologies and programming languages.
My expertise includes the Spring Framework for backend development, as well as Golang, Rust, and C++ with Qt.

Lately, I‚Äôve been learning Ada, exploring its strengths in safety-critical and high-integrity systems.

## <img class="main-icons" src="/images/r2d2.svg" alt="R2D2"> My tools

I currently use [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org) with [Plasma Desktop](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) as my development environment.
My preferred editors are Visual Studio Code and Qt Creator.

For deployments, I rely on [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com) to manage my VPS, and for version control, I use [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/carlavilla).
